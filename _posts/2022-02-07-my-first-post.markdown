A few months after graduating, I have realized that I don't really know a lot of stuff that I should, and that there are thousands of improvementes that I can work on.

Because of that, I've decided that it is time to start re-learning a lot of basic computer science, while also starting to get deeper knowledge about cloud computing. For the CS part, I'll be doing [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/moutella/coding-interview-university) alongside with [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/moutella). For the cloud Stuff, I haven't decided my path yet. I currently work with AWS, using a lot of Lambda, Step Functions and API Gateway, however, I feel that that's only the tip of the iceberg.

The language I will be using for the most part will be Python(3, of course), since I already use it a lot, however, sometimes I may challenge myself to work with C, just to check if I still am able to do low-level pointer stuff when messing with data-structures.

At the same time I'm doing this, I will write these blog posts in English, because I believe it's going to improve my ability to write and read in english. I also need to find a way to improve my speaking skills, but that is a problem for later

I won't be posting everyday, but I will definitely try to post at least twice a week.

Thank you for reading!
