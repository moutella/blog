I just saw the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOq5kSKqeR4) of the [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/moutella/coding-interview-university), where a Harvard student explains basic asymptotic notation, like what does O(n), O(1), O(n^2) means and so on, which is kind of a breeze for anyone who has taken a few computer science classes. However, I do admit that I had forgotten what does Î©(n) means, and what does Î˜(n) means, and that made me be humble, because I realized that yes, there is a lot of knowledge I don't know.

For anyone who doesn't know, like I didn't, here goes a very simplistic view of asymptotic notation:
- O: defines upper bound
- Î©: defines lower bound,
- Î˜: happens when the upper bound is the same as the lower bound

I decided to also watch the [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6mKVRU1evU) in the asymptotic notation part of the study, and apart from the quick explanation about O(n log n), everything is pretty basic for someone who has had a algorithm analysis class in college, which I did. I hope I don't feel this throughout the entire journey, otherwise I shall have to pick something else to use as the path for my studies.

This may be a little unfair with the repository, which is filled with good information about computer science, interviews, resumes and everything to help someone find themselves a career in software engineering, and I do realize the author does indeed say that he has not studied computer science in college, so maybe I do need something else. Well, I'll stick to the program at least for a week before jumping ship. Now, it's time to go back to do a few Hackerrank challenges

Thank you for reading!
