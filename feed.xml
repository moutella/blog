However, I do admit that I had forgotten what does Î©(n) means, and what does Î˜(n) means, and that made me be humble, because I realized that yes, there is a lot of knowledge I donâ€™t know.</p>

<p>I decided to also watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6mKVRU1evU">second video</a> in the asymptotic notation part of the study, and apart from the quick explanation about O(n log n), everything is pretty basic for someone who has had a algorithm analysis class in college, which I did. I hope I donâ€™t feel this throughout the entire journey, otherwise I shall have to pick something else to use as the path for my studies.</p>

<p>This may be a little unfair with the repository, which is filled with good information about computer science, interviews, resumes and everything to help someone find themselves a career in software engineering, and I do realize the author does indeed say that he has not studied computer science in college, so maybe I do need something else. Well, Iâ€™ll stick to the program at least for a week before jumping ship. Now, itâ€™s time to go back to do a few Hackerrank challenges</p>
